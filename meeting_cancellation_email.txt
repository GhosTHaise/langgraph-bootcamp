Dear Fitia,

Unfortunately,

I will not be able to attend the meeting as previously scheduled. I was looking forward to discussing the quarterly progress and future plans with the team at 10:00 AM next Wednesday. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

I will make sure to catch up on any important discussions and decisions made during the meeting. If there are any updates or changes that need my immediate attention, please let me know and I will do my best to accommodate them.

Thank you for your understanding and please let me know if there is anything I can do to compensate for my absence.

However, I can still make it to the meeting if we reschedule it for 12:00 PM Malagasy time in Antananarivo. Please let me know if this is feasible and I will make sure to adjust my schedule accordingly.

Best regards,
GhosT
