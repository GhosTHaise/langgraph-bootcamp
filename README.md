# üöÄ LangGraph Bootcamp

A **hands-on journey** into building intelligent, multi-step AI workflows with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph).
This repository contains **guided examples**, **notes**, and **exercises** following the [LangGraph Bootcamp series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM).

LangGraph helps developers **design, visualize, and execute agentic systems** ‚Äî structured graphs of interacting LLMs, tools, and memory. It‚Äôs part of the [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) ecosystem and focuses on **control, reliability, and debugging** for AI-driven applications.

## üß© What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a **framework for building stateful and structured AI systems**.
It lets you model complex agent flows as **graphs**, where each node represents a ‚Äústep‚Äù (like an LLM call, a tool invocation, or a conditional branch).

Think of it like:

> **LangChain** for logic,
> **LangGraph** for structure and orchestration.

You can:

* Build **autonomous agents** that reason and make decisions step-by-step.
* Design **multi-agent collaborations** (e.g., planner‚Äìexecutor setups).
* Implement **retries, loops, and conditional logic** safely around LLM calls.
* Add **checkpoints** to resume or inspect execution.
* Integrate with **LangSmith** for observability and tracing.

## üß± Key Concepts Covered

| Concept                    | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph Nodes**            | Individual components (LLMs, tools, memory, etc.) connected in a workflow. |
| **Edges**                  | Control the flow of information and decision-making between nodes.         |
| **State Management**       | Maintain structured data across steps with automatic type safety.          |
| **Streaming**              | Stream token outputs and intermediate steps live.                          |
| **Memory and Persistence** | Use checkpoints to persist and resume long-running graphs.                 |
| **Tool Usage**             | Integrate with LangChain tools for external API calls or computations.     |

Would you like me to include **a visual diagram (text-based or image)** showing how a typical LangGraph pipeline looks (nodes, edges, memory, etc.)? It really helps readers understand the ‚Äúgraph‚Äù concept at a glance.
